## Coding guidelines

### Code style
- Follow [Microsoft .NET coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
- Use `dotnet format` to clean up whitespace and formatting.
- No unrelated reformatting in PRs.

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal.  
- LapViz libraries should generally only depend on .NET BCL and explicitly approved packages.

### Unit tests
- All new code must include unit tests where applicable.
- Run `dotnet test` before submitting PRs.
- Do not break existing tests.

---

## Pull request process
- Ensure your branch builds successfully with no warnings or errors.
- Ensure all tests are passing (`dotnet test`).
- Update documentation if needed.
- Reference related issues in the PR description.
- Be responsive to feedback from maintainers.
- PRs may require rebasing if `main` has moved forward.
